//8. Create a program that declares an array of 5 integer values.These values will represent the
//	health of 5 characters.Initialise the values all to 100. Your program is to ask the user to
//	enter a number(0 to 4) to select a character that is to be attacked by a monster.Each attack
//	deals 40 damage per attack.If a player’s health gets below 0 then should not be able to be
//	attacked.Your program should simulate 5 attacks.After the attacks have finished, output
//	the parties’ remaining health to the console.

//	CHALLENGE: Research random number generation and modify your program so that random
//	damage is dealt with each attack.
